# Decentraland Challenge

Dapp development challenge for Decentraland. The goal here was to make a React + Vite frontend that allows users to display the balance and transfer a Dummy token from a Smart Contract provided by Decentraland. This repo is a monorepo containing both the front-end and the Dummy token hardhat project for local development.


## Demonstration

[Here is a Loom demo of the result.](https://www.loom.com/share/c24fdafa50a445848a3f0482d27a8560?sid=6e1165b1-89b3-4028-ab85-490ce16b01e9)

## Notes

- Didn't use Decentraland UI's Toast component since I wasn't convinced on the way it looked.
- Ran blockchain locally since the Dummy token repo had instructions on local Hardhat set up.
